This project focuses on analyzing public sentiment on major events using Twitter data as part of a Big Data Analytics study. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis models, the goal is to extract and interpret public opinion trends from large volumes of tweets. The project demonstrates how social media data can provide real-time insights into public perception during events such as elections, policy changes, natural disasters, and global crises.
